Advanced Machine Learning Project 

A dataset of undergraduate students from the Polytechnic Institute of Portalegre 
(Portugal) is used with predictive models to determine if a student will dropout or graduate. This projecty aims to determine critical features related to dropping out/graduating to drive 
action by administration in preventing more student dropouts. Variations of the dataset are also 
tested, using feature removal and feature engineering.


Key Findings: 

Academic success and financial situation are the two largest factors that impact a 
studentâ€™s ability to graduate. The former was proved through analysis on the raw dataset, while 
the latter was made clear by manipulating the dataset to remove academic performance features. 


Tools used for this project: 
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- NumPy

Skills practiced: 
- Deployment of different ML models (Random Forests, Neural Networks, Ensemble Methods)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
